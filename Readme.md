# Neuronal Dynamics Collab
This repo contains implementations of data processing and dynamical modelling for control of neuronal datasets and 
hypothetical ground truth models.

## Data preprocessing
Some tools for processing like kernel smoothing for Neuro pixel data can be found in `kernel smoothing` directory

## Dimension Reduction Setup
The dynamical modelling section is based on the assumption that data is available in a low order dimensional than the
given raw data in the form of images. The examples of dimension reduction methods are in `dimension analysis` directory.

## Subspace ID 
MATLAB scripts for system ID on raw data using subspace ID methods mentioned in Overschee et. al.

## Ground Truth Model
A validation setup where we make a dummy model with marginally stable modes with mixed frequencies
